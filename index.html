         <h1>the essentials of drawing an anime charecter</h1>
          <p>When drawing anime charecters you have to imagine them in your head then write down what you what them look like. If its an already made character then find a image that you think looks good and easy to draw. An example i would chose is Ciel Phantomhive from the anime titled "Kuroshitsuji" or for that inglish title "Black Butler": this character is one of my favorites to draw! he has a small figuer and the les details needed to parfect what you are drawing. </p>

          <p>when trying to draw the charecter you will have to creat a base structure of the body. a simple skecth of the face and go down to the feet to have a way to shape the body and them put details. this is how you would want to do the head od ciel.</p>
