         <h1>the essentials of drawing an anime charecter</h1>
         <p>When drawing anime charecters you have to imagine them in your head then write down what you what them lo like. If its an already made character then find a image that you think looks good and easy to draw. An example i would chose is Ciel Phantomhive from the anime titled "Kuroshitsuji" or for that inglish title "Black Butler":<img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d4/b2/03/d4b2030d6aecdcd06db22370e68d200f.jpg" height="250"/> this character is one of my favorites to draw! he has a small figuer and the les details needed to parfect what you are drawing. </p>
